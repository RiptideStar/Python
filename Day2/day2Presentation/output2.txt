[<p><a href="https://www.syracuse.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Website</a></p>, <p>The InclusiveU program at Syracuse University works <a href="https://taishoffcenter.syr.edu/inclusiveu/future/courses" rel="noopener noreferrer/ noreferrer" target="_blank">closely</a> with students with intellectual and developmental disabilities to give them a unique, fulfilling college experience. Students enrolled on the program take between one to three classes per semester. Once students have successfully completed five courses within one study area, they get a certificate allowing them to pursue skilled work. Syracuse University has a fantastic reputation for its disability inclusiveness. In fact, it “is known all over the world as a leader in disability and higher education.” However, the <a href="https://taishoffcenter.syr.edu/inclusiveu/admissions/cost/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cost</a> for InclusiveU is high for some students. Tuition and fees for students from out of New York State are $20,000 per year as well as up to $20,000 in support costs. Medicaid Waiver Self-Direction Funds and other funding opportunities may be able to pay for these costs, however. <em>Savingforcollege </em>and <em>Think College </em>both recommend Syracuse University.</p>, <p><a href="https://www.loras.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Website</a></p>, <p>The pre-orientation program on offer at Loras College is one of the best of its kind in America, according to <em>College Autism Network. College Autism Spectrum </em>also recommends the college. The pre-orientation program that <em>College Autism Network </em>highlights takes <a href="https://www.loras.edu/academics/academic-support/lynch-learning-center/arch/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">place</a> over five days in summer before the start of a student’s first year. It also allows the students to move into accommodations two days before other students. After this orientation, students are able to receive close support from certified autism specialists throughout study. Loras College has an additional charge for its autism services, but the college does not publicly reveal these costs.</p>, <p><a href="https://www.ancilla.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Website</a></p>, <p>The Autism Program at Ancilla College (APAC) is a relatively new <a href="https://www.ancilla.edu/autism/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">offering</a> from the college, being created in 2017. However, it has been successful already due to the fact that it utilizes highly trained faculty and staff members in its execution. APAC aims to provide challenging and engaging methods of support. APAC does have an additional fee on top of tuition, but Ancilla College does not state what that currently is. However, it does note that many students can <a href="https://www.ancilla.edu/scholarships/apac/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">offset</a> some of the costs of APAC through a scholarship of up to $2,000 per year. <em>College Autism Spectrum </em>and <em>College Autism Network </em>recommend Ancilla College.</p>, <p><a href="http://www.csueastbay.edu/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Website</a></p>, <p>In 2020, California State University, East Bay’s autism support program, The College Link Program, will <a href="http://www.csueastbay.edu/clp/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">enter</a> its 10th year. And over the course of almost a decade, this program has been a huge success. It <a href="https://mailchi.mp/ca34164f5784/clp-summer-2019-newsletter" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">boasts</a> a six year graduation rate of 75% of enrolled students, which is significantly higher than the college’s overall six year graduation rate of 48%. The College Link Program comes in four different levels, with different pricing. The lowest cost level is $3,000 per semester, and the highest cost level is $8,700 per semester. <em>College Autism Spectrum </em>and <em>College Autism Network </em>both recommend California State University, East Bay.</p>, <p><a href="https://www.nicholls.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Website</a></p>, <p>There are two different <a href="https://www.nicholls.edu/education/support-programs/bridge-to-independence/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">routes</a> that a student with autism can take at Nicholls State University. The first is the Two-Year Program for Students with Intellectual Disabilities, which is a two year certificate that helps students gain vital employability skills. The other route is for a student to enroll in a traditional four year degree program and receive additional support during study. Students enrolled in this program get given social skills seminars, systematic monitoring of performance, academic coaches and more. Nicholls State University does not list the costs for these programs, but <em>Think College </em>says that the four year traditional degree support services cost $2,055 per semester in addition to the base course tuition fees. <em>Think College </em>and <em>College Autism Spectrum </em>both recommend the college.</p>, <p><a href="https://siu.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Website</a></p>, <p>Over 80% of Southern Illinois University students who <a href="https://achieve.siu.edu/reportcard/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">enroll</a> into the college’s learning disabilities program, Achieve, remain in good academic standing at the college. This high level of success is due to the fact that the program has been <a href="https://achieve.siu.edu/services/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">running</a> for over 30 years. In that time, the program’s advisors, case managers, test proctors, academic coaches and content specific tutors have helped many students with autism achieve their educational and career goals. There are three levels of support in this program, with different <a href="https://achieve.siu.edu/fees/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">costs</a>. The lowest cost option is $2,000 per semester, and the highest cost option is $3,200 per semester. However, after one semester on the program, students can <a href="https://achieve.siu.edu/ahema/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">apply</a> for an award to pay for these fees. <em>Thinkcollege </em>and <em>Collegexpress </em>recommend Southern Illinois University.</p>, <p><a href="https://www.arizona.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Website</a></p>, <p>The Strategic Alternative Learning Techniques (SALT) Center at University of Arizona <a href="https://www.arizona.edu/news/2018/04/salt-center-model" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">supports</a> over 550 students with neurological disorders and learning disabilities. International universities, such as Japan’s Kansai University, have previously sent professors to this center, and they have all praised the college’s disability support, saying that it is leading the way in this growing field. The <a href="https://salt.arizona.edu/future-students/fees-scholarships" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">fees</a> for using the SALT Center’s service come in two tiers. The more expensive tier costs $3,100 per semester, which includes the cost of an individual tutor. The less expensive tier costs $1,500 per semester, but tutoring is billed at $25 per hour. Part time students are not charged for these services. There is a needs based scholarship for students who cannot afford these services. Another <a href="https://projectfocus.arizona.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">option</a> that the college offers is Project FOCUS (Focusing Opportunities with Community and University Supports.) This is its own certificate for students with intellectual disabilities (SALT is a support program for students taking traditional degrees.) Project FOCUS takes two years to complete and is only for students aged 18 to 22. The program <a href="https://projectfocus.arizona.edu/content/overview" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">enrolls</a> students in at least six credits per semester and also gives extra support to succeed with campus life, employment and independent living. University of Arizona does not reveal the tuition costs for Project FOCUS, but <em>Think College </em>states that it is $4,800 per year. <em>Savingforcollege </em>and <em>Think College </em>both name University of Arizona as being a great college for students with autism.</p>, <p><a href="http://www.usu.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Website</a></p>, <p>Students with autism who are <a href="https://www.usu.edu/drc/consultant" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">enrolled</a> in undergraduate/graduate degrees at Utah State University are able to work with an individual accessibility consultant who ensures that the student can overcome all barriers to success. The consultants are also able to provide counseling, advocacy and guidance referrals to students. The college does not say whether or not there is a separate fee for this consultant. However, the college’s transition program, which <a href="http://www.aggieselevated.usu.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">offers</a> two year certificates in Integrated College and Community Studies for students with intellectual disabilities is incredibly impressive. It boasts a 90% graduate employment rate. The <a href="http://www.aggieselevated.usu.edu/program/costs" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cost</a> for this program is $2,500 per semester.</p>, <p><a href="https://www.umsl.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Website</a></p>, <p>In 2013, University of Missouri, St. Louis was able to <a href="https://www.stltoday.com/news/local/education/umsl-program-gives-students-with-intellectual-disabilities-a-college-experience/article_bf9a0e2e-e3f7-5269-8389-979553342852.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">begin</a> a program for students with intellectual disabilities thanks to $200,000 in money from disability charities. In 2017, three-fourths of the students in that program had autism. This program, named the Succeed Program, is not offered in addition to a traditional degree. Instead, it is a two year program where students earn a certificate and learn invaluable employment skills. The cost of this <a href="https://www.umsl.edu/succeed/Prospective%20Students/program-fees.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">program</a> is $10,500. However, some students may need to pay two additional $5,250 fees for this education. Luckily, many students can <a href="https://www.umsl.edu/succeed/Funding%20and%20Payment%20Resources/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">access</a> a range of scholarships to help pay these fees. College Autism Spectrum and Think College both recommend University of Missouri, St, Louis.</p>, <p><a href="https://undergrad.tiu.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Website</a></p>, <p>One thing that <a href="https://undergrad.tiu.edu/academics/academic-support/access/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">sets</a> Trinity International University’s autism support program, Access, apart is that it has a strong spiritual basis. As a Christian college, a key part of the autism program is to give students with autism the opportunity to become part of a group that focuses on spiritual formation and development. It also includes one on one mentoring with educational advisors and peers, as well as social support groups and events. Access costs $2,000 per semester. <em>Savingforcollege </em>and <em>College Autism Network </em>both recommend Trinity International University.</p>, <p><a href="https://www.hofstra.edu/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Website</a></p>, <p>Hofstra University’s program for students with learning disabilities has been <a href="https://www.hofstra.edu/pdf/admission/admission-brochure-pals.pdf" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">running</a> for forty years. In this time, it has been able to develop an effective system that helps students with autism succeed. The Program for Academic Learning Skills (PALS) pairs students with a learning disability with a learning specialist from their first year until graduation, allowing them to form a close educational relationship with a specific advisor. There is a one time fee of $14,600 for this program, which works out to $1,825 per semester, assuming that a student studies for four years and takes two semesters a year. One advantage of this one time charge is that there are no extra support fees if a student takes longer than four years to complete their degree. <em>Savingforcollege </em>and <em>Collegexpress </em>both recommend Hofstra University.</p>, <p><a href="https://www.beaconcollege.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Website</a></p>, <p>While many colleges have special programs in place to support students with learning disabilities like autism, Beacon College is <a href="https://www.beaconcollege.edu/about-beacon-college/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">exclusively</a> for them. Thanks to the college’s specialization in supporting students who learn differently, it is perhaps the best possible college option for many students who have autism. In fact, the college’s teaching models are so effective that its four year graduation rate is an astonishing 83%. Tuition at this college <a href="https://www.beaconcollege.edu/admissions/tuition-financial-aid/tuition/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">costs</a> $52,526 per year. However, as the college is specifically designed to support students with conditions such as autism, there are no additional charges for support. <em>Savingforcollege </em>and <em>Collegexpress </em>both recommend Beacon College.</p>, <p><a href="https://www.du.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Website</a></p>, <p>Students with autism who <a href="https://www.du.edu/studentlife/learningeffectiveness/aboutus/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">attend</a> University of Denver benefit from the college’s Learning Effectiveness Program (LEP.) LEP has existed at the college since 1982. The <a href="https://www.du.edu/studentlife/learningeffectiveness/index.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">program</a> is for students with learning disabilities, including autism but also extending to ADHD, or even just students who learn differently. This program follows four cornerstones to develop a student’s educational path. These are self awareness, self advocacy, accountability and self determination. Services in this program include weekly academic counseling, tutoring, peer mentoring and more. The <a href="https://www.du.edu/studentlife/learningeffectiveness/faq.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cost</a> for this program is $1,350 per semester. <em>Savingforcollege </em>and <em>Collegexpress </em>both recommend University of Denver.</p>, <p><a href="https://www.arcadia.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Website</a></p>, <p>The two year Raising Expectations for Academic Learning (REAL) Certificate that Arcadia University offers students with autism the opportunity to gain two years of college experience.

Since starting, the REAL Certificate became so helpful for students with autism that <em>Autism Speaks </em>decided to <a href="https://www.arcadia.edu/news/2016/03/arcadia-program-earns-award-expand-program-students-disabilities" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">give</a> the program a scholarship that offered one returning and two new students $5,000 scholarships to help pay for their education. The cost of the certificate is $7,500 per semester. <em>Collegexpress </em>and <em>Think College</em> recommend Arcadia University.</p>, <p><a href="https://www.udel.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Website</a></p>, <p>In 2018, University of Delaware <a href="https://www.cds.udel.edu/item/university-of-delaware-launches-program-for-students-with-autism/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">became</a> one of the growing number of colleges that offer an autism support program. Initially, the Spectrum Scholars program has been <a href="https://www.cds.udel.edu/autism-initiatives/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">offered</a> to support students who major in Computer &amp; Information Sciences or Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering. Spectrum Scholars coaches students with autism on ways of developing study techniques, connections on campus and self determination skills. Thanks to <a href="https://www.cds.udel.edu/spectrum-scholars-faq/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">funding</a> from JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co, no student who enrolls into the Spectrum Scholars program has to pay extra money for its services. <em>College Autism Spectrum </em>and <em>College Autism Network </em>both recommend University of Delaware for students with autism.</p>, <p><a href="http://www.ufl.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Website</a></p>, <p>The primary <a href="https://disability.ufl.edu/students/get-involved/social-gators/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">focus</a> of SOCIAL Gators, University of Florida’s primary autism support program, is improving the social skills of students with autism. This program is a collaboration between three major departments of the college, the Center for Autism and Related Disabilities, the Counseling and Wellness Center and the Disability Resource Center. While SOCIAL Gators’s primary focus is on social interaction, many aspects of the program proactively link this social education to career and academic achievement, with mentors and meetings focusing on how students can use these skills to enhance their future careers. Impressively, this program does not come with an additional cost for students <em>College Autism Spectrum </em>and <em>College Autism Network </em>both recommend University of Florida for students with autism.</p>, <p><a href="http://www.goldenwestcollege.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Website</a></p>, <p>Golden West College’s Comprehensive Autism Program (CAP) provides multifaceted support to its students and employees. Students in CAP have access to invaluable personalized services that enhance their scholastic and personal success. Peer support is a major focus of the program. The LOOP, a student organization within CAP, provides support through weekly meetings with advisors to discuss topics related to being an autistic college student.</p>, <p>Through The LOOP, students develop meaningful relationships with peers and support staff who enhance their sense of belonging at GWC and in the community. They receive individual academic, social, emotional, and career and transfer counseling, and create impactful personal connections with support staff and faculty. Students have the option to work with the same counselor from intake to graduation, receive academic coaching and case management oversight, attend workshops, and experience an array of peer mentoring and campus activities.</p>, <p>Through CAP and related activities, GWC demonstrates campus-wide support for autistic students. The College guarantees that enrolled students do not incur costs beyond tuition for participating in CAP. Additionally, each April, GWC hosts an annual celebration of neurodiversity during Autism Spectrum Week. This exciting series of events includes activities and learning opportunities for all students, faculty, staff, and administrators at GWC. </p>, <p>For more information on CAP, please contact Denise Gonzalez Bon @ <a href="http://dbon.gwc.cccd.edu/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">dbon.gwc.cccd.edu</a>. <a href="http://www.goldenwestcollege.edu/dsps/asd/index.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">www.goldenwestcollege.edu/dsps/asd/index.html</a></p>, <p><a href="https://www.appstate.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Website</a></p>, <p>Appalachian State University is one of several colleges on this list that, instead of offering an autism support program for students enrolled into typical degrees, runs a two year program for people with diverse abilities. Students with autism can <a href="https://sdap.appstate.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">benefit</a> from enrolling into the Scholars with Diverse Abilities Program (SDAP,) as it takes two years to complete and provides a range of employment opportunities afterwards. A major advantage of this program is that it is highly flexible to an individual student’s educational interests, because it allows students to choose their own academic, career, personal and social goals. It does this by <a href="https://sdap.appstate.edu/about" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">letting</a> students set their own schedules and enroll in courses that interest them. The cost for this program is $1,000 per semester. <em>Savingforcollege</em> and <em>Think College </em>both recommend Appalachian State University.</p>, <p><a href="http://www.taftcollege.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Website</u></a></p>, <p>Students with autism at Taft College are able to apply to the <a href="https://www.taftcollege.edu/til/til-home/general-information/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Transition to Independent Living Program</u></a> (TIL.) The program is for any student who has developmental/intellectual disabilities. It is significantly older than many similar programs in American colleges, with the program beginning in 1995. However, some aspects of TIL’s approach can be traced to classes that have been running at the college since 1976. But what really makes the TIL program exceptional is the fact that it is there for students long after they graduate. In fact, it “tracks graduates for a 10 year period.” Unlike some college programs, TIL is not offered in addition to a degree. Instead, it is a program that focuses on developing a student’s employable skills without the student undertaking a specific major or minor. The TIL Program does not have a fee but does charge students who live on campus or in college rental fees. <em>College Autism Spectrum </em>and <em>Think College </em>recommend Taft College.</p>, <p><a href="https://education.uiowa.edu/services/reach" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Website</a></p>, <p><em>Autism Speaks, Savingforcollege </em>and <em>Think College </em>all cite University of Iowa’s Realizing Education and Career Hopes (REACH) program as being a great example of a program that supports students through college. REACH is only <a href="https://education.uiowa.edu/services/reach" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">open</a> to students who are aged between 18 to 25 years old and “offers an integrated college experience in a caring and structured environment.” The students who enroll can earn two, three or four year certificates. Perhaps the best part of University of Iowa’s REACH program is that it proactively helps students who are enrolled in it to find a career after college. It does this through running mock job interviews, finding internships and organizing field trips to potential employers. Per year, REACH <a href="https://education.uiowa.edu/services/ui-reach-realizing-educational-and-career-hopes/apply-ui-reach" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">costs</a> Iowa residents $17,300 and non-Iowa residents $35,400. There is an additional fee of $1,533 for all students.</p>, <p><a href="https://www.pace.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Website</a></p>, <p>The autism program at Pace University, the Ongoing Academic Social Instructional Support program <a href="https://www.pace.edu/oasis" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">describes</a> itself as being “one of the most comprehensive support services for students with high functioning autism.” It <a href="https://www.pace.edu/oasis/about" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">achieves</a> this through allowing students with autism to meet with an academic coach for one hour every day, providing an educational coordinator, providing a housing coordinator, providing social coaches, providing social coordinators, providing social workers, providing internship coordinators and providing further testing/assignment accommodations. This program <a href="https://www.pace.edu/admissions-aid/undergraduate-admissions/international/fee-schedule" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">costs</a> $7,000 per academic year and an additional $800 if a student uses it over the summer. <em>Autism Speaks, Collegexpress, </em>and <em>College Autism Network </em>all recommend Pace University for students with autism.</p>, <p><a href="https://www.emich.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Website</a></p>, <p>The peer mentoring services at Eastern Michigan University are some of the finest in America, <em>College Autism Network </em>states. <em>College Autism Spectrum </em>and<em> Collegexpress </em>also laud the college’s autism services. However, the autism support services on offer at Eastern Michigan University go much further than peer mentoring. In fact, it is able to <a href="https://www.emich.edu/collegesupportsprogram/programcomponents/index.php" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">offer</a> students enrolled into the College Supports Program 24 hour support. However, this offering comes at a cost. The fees are <a href="https://www.emich.edu/collegesupportsprogram/servicesandfees/index.php" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">tailored</a> to each student’s needs, but the college estimates that many students will have to pay between $5,500 per semester to $7,000 per semester for its services.</p>, <p><a href="http://www.defiance.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Website</a></p>, <p>In 2014, Defiance College <a href="http://www.defiance.edu/offices/pr-marketing/2014/1401-asd-affinity-program.html" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">expanded</a> upon an autism program that had previously aided students with autism in getting a high school level of education. In this expanded program, students with autism could receive support throughout the length of a four year degree. And those students who have participated in the program have all praised the way in which it has helped them succeed in a degree setting. For instance, students have <a href="https://www.journalgazette.net/news/local/schools/20180429/defiance-autism-program-wins-students-kudos" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">said</a> that the staff members “are highly engaged,” and another said that “They pulled out all the stops,” to help him succeed. The cost for Defiance College’s ASD Affinity Program is $6,000 per semester. <em>Collegexpress, College Autism Spectrum </em>and<em> College Autism Network </em>all recommend Defiance College.</p>, <p><a href="http://www.ttu.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Website</a></p>, <p>On the Texas Tech University <a href="https://www.depts.ttu.edu/burkhartcenter/about/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">campus</a> is the Burkhart Center for Autism Education and Research.

Every student enrolled into the CASE program is paired with a learning specialist who “empowers students to problem solve their concerns more effectively and efficiently.” Texas Tech University does not state the cost of its autism program, but <em>College Autism Spectrum </em>states that it is $6,000 per fall and spring semester and $1,500 per summer session. <em>Savingforcollege, College Autism Spectrum </em>and <em>College Autism Network </em>all recommend Texas Tech University.</p>, <p><a href="https://uconn.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Website</a></p>, <p>Both <em>Autism Speaks </em>and <em>Collegexpress </em>rank University of Connecticut highly in terms of autism support. However, both of these sources list programs which have since been merged into other disability programs at the college. <em>Savingforcollege </em>lists the college’s current program, Beyond Access, in its list, noting that strategy instructors spend up to three hours a week with students with learning disabilities. Students who want to <a href="https://csd.uconn.edu/beyondaccess/#" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">participate</a> in the Beyond Access program can choose between four different levels of engagement, each with a different cost. The lowest cost program provides support for one hour a week and costs $1,800 per semester. The highest cost program provides support for three hours a week and costs $3,600 per semester.</p>, <p><a href="https://www.sju.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Website</a></p>, <p>Students with autism who <a href="https://6abc.com/health/sju-offers-unique-supports-for-students-on-autism-spectrum/4443874/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">attend</a> Saint Joseph’s University have an 85% graduation rate. This strong level of college completion is <a href="https://kinneyautism.sju.edu/s/1378/kinney/interior-hybrid.aspx?sid=1378&amp;gid=56&amp;pgid=2651" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">primarily</a> thanks to the college’s Kinney Center for Autism Education and Support, which aids both students and the general population. This autism center has existed since 2009. But the college’s autism activities have been happening since long before the opening of this center, with the college’s first autism awareness day taking place in April 2004. The autism support program, ASPIRE, <a href="https://kinneyautism.sju.edu/s/1378/kinney/interior-hybrid.aspx?sid=1378&amp;gid=56&amp;pgid=2669" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">costs</a> $6,000 per year. For the first time ever, the Kinney Center for Autism is expanding its college support program to virtually serve individuals with autism at campuses throughout the country. Over the past decade ASPIRE students have defied national college completion rates, boasting an 84% success rate. <em>Collegexpress, College Autism Spectrum </em>and <em>Savingforcollege </em>all recommend Saint Joseph’s University.</p>, <p><a href="https://www.wright.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Website</a></p>, <p>A current student who has participated in the Wright State University’s autism support services <a href="https://www.wright.edu/diversity-and-inclusion/disability-services/autism-spectrum-support" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">says</a> this: “The challenges I ran into might have overwhelmed me if my transition coach hadn’t been there to help. […] The support group helped me simply by reminding me that I’m not an alien, and that there are others with similar problems.” The primary means of autism support at the college involves employing students as transition coaches to help students acclimatize to college life. This service costs $750 per semester in the student’s first year and $300 per semester for further years. The college’s other autism support resource is the support group, which does not have a cost.

And many of the peer mentors that help those in the program are students of the college’s School of Speech, Language, Hearing and Occupational Sciences. The costs of some of University of Montana’s autism services are not listed, but peer mentoring, social evenings, ed ready support and academic support only costs $20 per semester. <em>Think College </em>reports that other support services cost $130 per session. <em>College Autism Spectrum, College Autism Network </em>and <em>Think College </em>recommend this college.</p>, <p><a href="https://www.apsu.edu/index.php" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Website</a></p>, <p>The seminars that are designed for students with autism at Austin Peay State University are specifically highlighted by <em>College Autism Network </em>as being effective. <em>Collegexpress </em>and<em> College Autism Spectrum </em>also recommend this college.

In addition to the typical peer mentoring and coaching services, this program also works with students and faculty who are not on the autistic spectrum with the aim of boosting their empathy and understanding to people who have autism. The cost for this program is $2,500, but thanks to scholarships and other funding opportunities, 100% of students involved in the program have been able to avoid paying for this themselves.</p>, <p><a href="https://msu.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Website</a></p>, <p>Since 2010, Building Opportunities for Networking and Discovery (BOND) has <a href="https://www.rcpd.msu.edu/programs/signature-programs/bond" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">been</a> Michigan State University’s autism program.

It began as a collaboration between the college’s Disability Resource Center and its College of Education and Human Services. Through focusing on three primary areas, social skills, independence skills and career development skills, THRIVE is able to ensure that students with autism are able to get the support that they need. No one student’s experience of THRIVE is the same, as the program tailors its levels of support to each individual. There is no extra cost for a student to participate in THRIVE. <em>College Autism Spectrum, College Autism Network </em>and <em>Think College </em>all recommend University of North Florida.</p>, <p><a href="https://www.uidaho.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Website</a></p>, <p>University of Idaho’s Raven Scholars Program for students with autism has been an incredibly successful college <a href="https://www.uidaho.edu/current-students/cdar/raven-scholars" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">resource</a> since it began in 2011. Just one year after its foundation, the Raven Scholars Program won The May Dunn Ward Innovative Program Award. The program allows students to have meetings either every day or every week as well as opportunities for peer-mentoring, individual coaching, life/social skills coaching, social events, on campus coordination, advocacy and more.

Of these sources, none is more impressed than College Autism Network, which specifically highlights the college’s counseling as being exemplary for students with autism. The most encompassing area of <a href="https://view2.fdu.edu/inside-fdu-edu/compass/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">support</a> for students with autism at Fairleigh Dickinson University is the College’s COMPASS program. This program is available on both the college’s Metropolitan Campus and Florham Campus.

In its first year, it served eight students. In 2019, it served 39 students. The services on offer in this program are peer mentors, learning strategists, credit based individualized college transition classes and social events. Justin Boachie, a computer game design student who participates in the program says “It’s a program that cuts down on our mistakes and blossoms new traits out of our character.” The <a href="https://ds.gmu.edu/mason-autism-support-initiative/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cost</a> for this program is $6,600 per year. <em>Savingforcollege, College Autism Spectrum, Collegexpress, College Autism Network </em>and <em>Think College </em>all recommend George Mason University.</p>, <p><a href="http://www.marshall.edu/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Website</a></p>, <p>Every single methodology list except for <em>Think College</em> recommends Marshall University’s West Virginia Autism Training Center. <em>US News </em>recounts the successful experience of a particular student, who was a senior at the time of being interviewed. <em>Savingforcollege </em>praises the intensive level of support that counselors give to students with autism. <em>Autism Speaks </em>interviews the founder of the college’s West Virginia Autism Training Center, who reveals that she created the center because when it was time for her son to consider higher education, there were no resources available. In fact, Marshall University’s autism training center was the first of its kind in the entirety of the United States. Initially, the center focused on training teachers in how to teach people with autism. It has since expanded into proactively assisting the college’s own students with autism. The center’s <a href="http://www.marshall.edu/collegeprogram/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">program</a> for students with autism initially assesses a student’s social, communication, academic, leisure and personal living skills.

The program <a href="https://financial-aid.adelphi.edu/tuition/fees/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">costs</a> $4,435 per semester. Adelphi University is also always looking for new ways to cater for its students who have autism.
