There are many different ways in which people with autism are affected by the condition. And there are so many different types of colleges in America that it can be hard to tell which one is right for you. This means that a potential student with autism may struggle to identify their ideal higher educational destination. However, there are some colleges in the USA that stand out for their commitment towards making their education accessible to any student who has autism. And this list is going to highlight those colleges.</p>, <p>Autism was only identified in the early 20<sup>th</sup> century. And even after its identification, it took many years for society to understand what autism is. In many ways, the world is still learning the best ways to accommodate people who have autism. But as institutions that naturally work to pave the way for the future, American colleges have some of the best autism accommodations in the world today. No one college has the perfect program or facilities to help all students with autism. But many are trying innovative and effective new approaches. Colleges that are applying these techniques with success have been specifically highlighted in this list.</p>, <sup>th</sup>, <p>Unfortunately, the colleges that do have autism programs tend to have wildly varying costs for these. Some institutions charge over $9,000 per semester. But others offer them for free. It is not readily apparent which colleges are offering the most cost-effective autism support. Therefore, this article goes out of its way to highlight the costs for any featured college autism support program. And if the college does not state these costs, then that fact is mentioned instead.</p>, <p>Any one of the 50 colleges below is an excellent choice for a student who has autism. However, it’s also true that every single person has their own personal circumstances that affect their ideal college choice. That means that potentially none of the colleges below is right for you. If that’s the case, then this list can still be useful. Every entry has its own detailed summary of what the college is doing to accommodate students with autism. These summaries have been included so that you can see why these colleges are great for students with autism. You can use these to contrast and compare with your own college options. If any of your college options are accommodating students like these colleges below, then that’s a sure sign that it’s the right college for you.</p>, <h3>Methodology</h3>, <p>Many of our sources have stated what colleges can do to be more appealing to people with autism. And many of our sources have listed what they consider to be the best colleges for students with autism. In that case, this article combines the results of the college lists and applies further research into what the colleges are doing to address the concerns listed in the sources. This combination of our sources and further research ensures that the colleges do indeed have the autism-friendly approaches that the sources claim.</p>, <p>Our list of sources is as follows:</p>,

Students enrolled on the program take between one to three classes per semester. Once students have successfully completed five courses within one study area, they get a certificate allowing them to pursue skilled work. Syracuse University has a fantastic reputation for its disability inclusiveness. In fact, it “is known all over the world as a leader in disability and higher education.” However, the <a href="https://taishoffcenter.syr.edu/inclusiveu/admissions/cost/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">cost</a> for InclusiveU is high for some students.

Students in CAP have access to invaluable personalized services that enhance their scholastic and personal success. Peer support is a major focus of the program. The LOOP, a student organization within CAP, provides support through weekly meetings with advisors to discuss topics related to being an autistic college student.</p>, <p>Through The LOOP, students develop meaningful relationships with peers and support staff who enhance their sense of belonging at GWC and in the community. They receive individual academic, social, emotional, and career and transfer counseling, and create impactful personal connections with support staff and faculty. Students have the option to work with the same counselor from intake to graduation, receive academic coaching and case management oversight, attend workshops, and experience an array of peer mentoring and campus activities.</p>, <p>Through CAP and related activities, GWC demonstrates campus-wide support for autistic students. The College guarantees that enrolled students do not incur costs beyond tuition for participating in CAP. Additionally, each April, GWC hosts an annual celebration of neurodiversity during Autism Spectrum Week. This exciting series of events includes activities and learning opportunities for all students, faculty, staff, and administrators at GWC. </p>, <p>For more information on CAP, please contact Denise Gonzalez Bon @ <a href="http://dbon.gwc.cccd.edu/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">dbon.gwc.cccd.edu</a>. <a href="http://www.goldenwestcollege.edu/dsps/asd/index.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">www.goldenwestcollege.edu/dsps/asd/index.html</a></p>, <a href="http://dbon.gwc.cccd.edu/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">dbon.gwc.cccd.edu</a>, <a href="http://www.goldenwestcollege.edu/dsps/asd/index.html" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">www.goldenwestcollege.edu/dsps/asd/index.html</a>, <h3>33.

The program is for any student who has developmental/intellectual disabilities. It is significantly older than many similar programs in American colleges, with the program beginning in 1995. However, some aspects of TIL’s approach can be traced to classes that have been running at the college since 1976. But what really makes the TIL program exceptional is the fact that it is there for students long after they graduate. In fact, it “tracks graduates for a 10 year period.” Unlike some college programs, TIL is not offered in addition to a degree. Instead, it is a program that focuses on developing a student’s employable skills without the student undertaking a specific major or minor. The TIL Program does not have a fee but does charge students who live on campus or in college rental fees. <em>College Autism Spectrum </em>and <em>Think College </em>recommend Taft College.</p>, <a href="https://www.taftcollege.edu/til/til-home/general-information/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank"><u>Transition to Independent Living Program</u></a>, <u>Transition to Independent Living Program</u>, <em>College Autism Spectrum </em>, <em>Think College </em>, <h3>31.

In 2019, it focused on youth voices and included participants that were college students.
