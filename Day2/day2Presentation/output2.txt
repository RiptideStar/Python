[…] The support group helped me simply by reminding me that I’m not an alien, and that there are others with similar problems.” The primary means of autism support at the college involves employing students as transition coaches to help students acclimatize to college life. This service costs $750 per semester in the student’s first year and $300 per semester for further years. The college’s other autism support resource is the support group, which does not have a cost. Staff members of the college’s Office of Disability Services are also trained to help students on the autistic spectrum through these programs.
