Because the program is run by the University of Alabama Autism Spectrum Disorders Research Clinic, its staff includes a blend of undergraduates, graduate students, and licensed clinical psychologists. But the quality of the staff is not the only reason UA stands out among the best colleges with autism programs. In fact, ACTS primarily earns its reputation thanks to its diverse catalog of support services. These include thrice weekly check-ins with a therapist/mentor, weekly living skills check-ins, and progress reports from instructors to ensure that students are getting the help they need in the classroom."</td>
