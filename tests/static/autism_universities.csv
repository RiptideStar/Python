In fact, ACTS primarily earns its reputation thanks to its diverse catalog of support services. These include thrice weekly check-ins with a therapist/mentor, weekly living skills check-ins, and progress reports from instructors to ensure that students are getting the help they need in the classroom.""","""https://www.ua.edu/""","""https://www.bestvalueschools.com/rankings/students-with-autism/""",
